      <h3>The Road to Enlightenment</h3>
      <p>
        Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of browser-specific
        tags, incompatible DOMs, broken CSS support, and abandoned browsers.
      </p>
      <p>
        We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been achieved
        thanks to the tireless efforts of folk like the W3C, WaSP, and the major
        browser creators.

        <h2>So What is This About?</h2>
        <div class="statement">
          <p>
            There is a continuing need to show the power of CSS. The Zen Garden
            aims to excite, inspire, and encourage participation. To begin, view
            some of the existing designs in the list. Clicking on any one will
            load the style sheet into this very page. The HTML remains the same,
            the only thing that has changed is the external CSS file. Yes,
            really.
          </p>
          <p>
            CSS allows complete and total control over the style of a hypertext
            document. The only way this can be illustrated in a way that gets
            people excited is by demonstrating what it can truly be, once the
            reins are placed in the hands of those able to create beauty from
            structure. Designers and coders alike have contributed to the beauty
            of the web; we can always push it further.

        <p>Strong visual design has always been our focus.
           You are modifying this page, so strong CSS skills 
           are necessary too, but the example files are commented
            well enough that even CSS novices can use them as starting points. 
            Please see the CSS Resource Guide for advanced tutorials and tips on working with CSS.</p>

        <p>You may modify the style sheet in any way you wish, 
          but not the HTML. This may seem daunting at first if you’ve never worked this way before,
           but follow the listed links to learn more, and use the sample files as a guide.</p>
        <p>
          Download the sample HTML and CSS to work on a copy locally.
           Once you have completed your masterpiece (and please, don’t submit half-finished work)
            upload your CSS file to a web server under your control. Send us a link to an archive of 
            that file and all associated assets, and if we choose to use it we will download it and 
            place it on our server.</p>

              Where possible, we would like to see mostly CSS 
              1 & 2 usage. CSS 3 & 4 should be limited to widely-supported elements only,
               or strong fallbacks should be provided. The CSS Zen 
               Garden is about functional, practical CSS and not the 
               latest bleeding-edge tricks viewable by 2% of the browsing public. 
               The only real requirement we have is that your CSS validates.

            <p>
              Luckily, designing this way shows how well various browsers have implemented CSS by now. 
              When sticking to the guidelines you should see fairly consistent results across most modern browsers. 
              Due to the sheer number of user agents on the web these days — especially when you factor in mobile — 
              pixel-perfect layouts may not be possible across every platform. That’s okay, but do test in as many as you can. 
              Your design should work in at least IE9+ and the latest Chrome,

            <p>We ask that you submit original artwork.
                 Please respect copyright laws. 
                 Please keep objectionable material to a minimum,
                  and try to incorporate unique and interesting 
                  visual themes to your work. We’re well past the 
                  point of needing another garden-related design.

              You retain full copyright on your graphics (with limited exceptions,

              CSS under a Creative Commons license identical
